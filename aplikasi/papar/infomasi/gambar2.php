	From the corner diner where families enjoy breakfast on Sunday morning, to the luxurious steakhouses where the world`s business is conducted, 
	US Foods products help shape the communities where people live and work. Our success is a tribute to five generations of employees. Several 
	of the entities that make up US Foods were founded in the 19th century. Monarch Foods, for example, is linked to a Dubuque, Iowa company that 
	sold provisions for wagon trains heading west in the 1850s. John Sexton and Company began as a tea and coffee merchant in Chicago in 1883.
